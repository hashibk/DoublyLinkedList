# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This C++ program implements a doubly linked list (DLL) with various operations such as insertion at the start, end, or middle, deletion of nodes, and removal of duplicates. It also supports printing the list in both forward and reverse order.

## Features

- **Insert at Start**: Insert a value at the beginning of the list.
- **Insert at End**: Insert a value at the end of the list.
- **Insert at Middle**: Insert a value at the middle of the list.
- **Insert Before**: Insert a value before a specified node.
- **Delete from Start**: Remove the first node of the list.
- **Delete from End**: Remove the last node of the list.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate all duplicate values in the list.
- **Print in Order**: Display the list in forward order.
- **Print in Reverse Order**: Display the list in reverse order.

## Usage

1. **Insert Nodes**: Use functions to insert nodes at the start, end, or middle of the list.
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate all duplicates from the list.
3. **Insert Before**: Insert a value before a node containing a specific value.
4. **Delete Nodes**: Remove nodes from the start or end of the list.
5. **Print**: Display the list in both forward and reverse order.

### Example

In the code:

- Nodes with values `7`, `9`, `10`, and `15` are inserted at various positions.
- Duplicate values are removed.
- The value `6` is inserted before the node containing `10`.

**Output**:
